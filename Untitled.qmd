## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
1 + 1


```

The mean of 1 and 2 and 3 is `r mean(c(1,2,3))`.

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r}
#| include: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
